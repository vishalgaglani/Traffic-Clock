# Traffic Clock


For people working from home, especially in Los Angeles, it would be nice to have a visual representation of the times when it best to leave the house.


This app would find travel time to the closests 5-10 starbucks locations once every hour for 24 hours using the Google Maps API via whatever server side language that is not PHP


From there it would rank the times from worst to best and assign them a corresponding color.


Using D3 js we could draw an AM and PM clock on the screen in 12 hour intervals.  This would give people an easy visual representation of traffic patterns. 


## Future Releases


Create single page where user can type in email and address and then recieve a full traffic clock 24 hours later.
